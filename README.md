# TelegraSpyBot
This is my small but efficient spy bot, just to try my skills

First of all you need to obtain your Telegram API api_hash and api_id through https://my.telegram.org/auth?to=apps
Also you need to create your bot through BotFather and obtain your token
Then run the requirements
> pip install -r requirements.txt
You need to put the username that you want to spy after, I have indicated it there in the scipt
Run the script
Run your bot in the Telegram
Note: that the username shall be within your contacts
PS: sometimes telegram server may ban you because of too much request. That's what I am now trying to figure out how to resolve it.
